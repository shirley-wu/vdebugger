## Environment Setup

This code is partially adapted from [ViperGPT](https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/viper). We sincerely thank the authors of ViperGPT for their great work!

To setup the environment, you should:
1. Clone recursively:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:shirley-wu/vdebugger.git
```
2. Install pytorch based on your own environment. We installed `torch==2.1.2` with cuda 12.1
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Setup ViperGPT environments by:
```bash
cd viper
bash download_models.sh
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
cd GLIP
python setup.py clean --all build develop --user
```
5. If you need to use openai APIs: write api key into `viper/api.key`

## Generation and Execution of Visual Programs

Go to `viper/` for this step. We recommend first generating and then executing the visual programs in two separate steps. Take GQA dataset as an example:
1. Generate programs:
```bash
CONFIG_NAMES=generate/gqa python main_batch_generate.py
```
This script will load the configuration under `config/generate/gqa.yaml`. Please remember to change YOUR_DATA_DIR into your data directory. The generated code will be saved in a csv under `code` field

2. Execute and evaluate programs:
```bash
CONFIG_NAMES=execute/gqa python main_batch_execute.py
```
This script will load the configuration under `config/execute/gqa.yaml`. Please also remember to update YOUR_DATA_DIR, and change the `cached_codex_path:` field into the csv produced in step 1. The accuracy / IoU will be computed.

3. If you want to obtain execution feedback:
```bash
CONFIG_NAMES=execute/gqa python main_batch_trace.py A_RANDOM_STAMP
```
You can use the same configuration as in step 2. If you want to run multiple `main_batch_trace.py` in the same time, please use different `A_RANDOM_STAMP` for different processes. The execution feedback will be saved in a csv under `traced` field.

## Inference of VDebugger

For inference with VDebugger, it is required to first generate and execute visual programs, and obtain a csv file containing `traced` field. Then, go to `vdebugger/`. Take GQA dataset and VDebugger/VDebugger-{critic, refiner}-generalist-13B as an example:
```bash
# Step 1: infer critic
python infer_critic.py VDebugger/VDebugger-critic-generalist-13B --input YOUR_CSV_CONTAINING_TRACED_FIELD --dataset gqa  # output file will be written to critic-infer.csv
# Step 2: infer refiner
python infer_refine.py critic-infer.csv VDebugger/VDebugger-refiner-generalist-13B  # output file will be written to critic-refine-infer.csv
```
Then you can execute the programs in `critic-refine-infer.csv` as in step 2 of [Generation and Execution of Visual Programs](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#generation-and-execution-of-visual-programs)

## Run VDebugger for Multiple Iterations

To run VDebugger for `T` iterations (`T` > 1), you first need to generate the initial programs and collect their execution feedback as in step 1 and 3 in [Generation and Execution of Visual Programs](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#generation-and-execution-of-visual-programs). Then, you need to repeat the steps below for `T` times:
1. Infer critic, as in [Inference of VDebugger](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#inference-of-vdebugger);
2. Infer refiner, as in [Inference of VDebugger](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#inference-of-vdebugger);
3. Collect execution feedback for the new programs generated by refiner, as in step 2 in [Generation and Execution of Visual Programs](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#generation-and-execution-of-visual-programs). The next iteration will be run on top of the feedback collected in this step.

Then after `T` iterations, evaluate the final programs as in step 2 in [Generation and Execution of Visual Programs](https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#generation-and-execution-of-visual-programs).

Since the major computational overhead comes from program execution (i.e. step 3 in each iteration), you can use the helper scripts `remove_dup.py` and `merge_csv.py` in [vdebugger/interative_helper](vdebugger/iterative_helper) to reduce the redundant execution:
* Before step 3 in each iteration, remove the programs that are duplicate as last iteration, by executing:
```bash
python remove_dup.py PROGRAM_CSV_FROM_LAST_ITERATION PROGRAM_CSV_FOR_THIS_ITERATION
```
which will produce a dedup file `PROGRAM_CSV_FOR_THIS_ITERATION_DEDUP`
* Then collect execution feedback for the resulted `PROGRAM_CSV_FOR_THIS_ITERATION_DEDUP`.
* After collecting their feedback, merge the execution feedback from the last iteration and the current iteration:
```bash
python merge_csv.py EXECUTION_FEEDBACK_FROM_LAST_ITERATION EXECUTION_FEEDBACK_FOR_THIS_ITERATION_DEDUP
```
which will produce a file `EXECUTION_FEEDBACK_FOR_THIS_ITERATION_MERGED` containing merged execution results. For the next iteration, use the merged execution results.

There will still be some repeated computation within step 1 and 2 in this iteration, but that will be tolerable. If you are concerned, you can modify the scripts by yourself to avoid the computation.

## Training of VDebugger

If you want to reproduce our training of VDebugger, please use `vdebugger/training_scripts/train_{critic, refiner}.sh`. You will need to install `deepspeed==0.14.0`.

## Error Injection

To perform error injection and generate incorrect programs as described in Section 4 of our paper, you first need a `.csv` file containing the visual programs generated for the training set and their execution results. Then, please go to `vdebugger/` and run:
```bash
python error_injection.py YOUR_CSV_FILE --error_injection {greedy, mask-best}
```
